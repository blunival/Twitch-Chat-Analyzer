I couldn't stand it, I was going crazy. I decided to pull out my big long willy and start jerking. I never had felt so good, I soon continued to do this daily and never got bored of it! that big red bird was so hot and those blue ones were some cuties. I am glad to admit I still do this

You'll get the money. But no one will remember this game when you're gone. They'll replace you with another streamer. You'll be but a memory. Do you think these 30 kills will make your family proud? No. So spend time with your loved ones. Take a break. Go outside. Make new friends. And come back.

You'll get the money. But no one will remember this game when you're gone. They'll replace you with another streamer. You'll be but a memory. Do you think these 30 kills will make your family proud? No. So spend time with your loved ones. Take a break. Go outside. Make new friends. And come back.

You'll get the money. But no one will remember this game when you're gone. They'll replace you with another streamer. You'll be but a memory. Do you think these 30 kills will make your family proud? No. So spend time with your loved ones. Take a break. Go outside. Make new friends. And come back.

Picture a scenario where the intelligent apes from the Planet of the Apes universe discover the virtual world of Valorant.
