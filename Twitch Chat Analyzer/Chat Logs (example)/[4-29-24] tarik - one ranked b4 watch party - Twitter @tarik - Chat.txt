I just thought maybe it’d be fun to roleplay with you as your online gf maybe? I know you’re straight. I’m a boy that’s why I was saying roleplay.. this isn’t a troll. again, I know it’s really random and weird. I’m sorry. It would just be a fun online relationship - nothing serious and I could donate to you and your stream and support you and just be here

[3:13:51] stay_hopeful: The relationship between particles and moles is defined by Avogadro's constant, which states that one mole of any substance contains approximately  6.022 × 1 0 23 6.022×10  23   particles. This constant allows scientists to relate the quantity of particles to the amount of substance in moles, facilitating calculations in chemistry and physics.

[6:15:21] angelbestau: How blatant can Valve be? Seriously? So instead of the spike they have something called a "bomb"? Instead of abilities they have "nades mollies and smokes". Instead of agents it's terrorists and counter-terrorists? What is this the 1970s? It's almost as if they copied but halfway through they got lazy and just released the game. Valve should be ashamed of themselves. I guess imitation is the best form of flattery, Riot is so kind to not come after Valve legally. Blatant rip off of Valorant this

Honestly you guys need a life lmfao, sitting it a streamers chat all day wont make you feel better and it wont improve your chances of sleeping with her, not like you had any to begin with lmfao. you guys are just so pathetic.
